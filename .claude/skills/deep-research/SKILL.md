Research this thoroughly and report back: $ARGUMENTS

1. Find the relevant files with Glob and Grep before reading anything.
2. Read only what the question requires.
3. Return: a short summary, then the specific `path:line` references supporting it, then
   anything that contradicts the obvious answer.

Do not modify any file. If the answer is not in the codebase, say so rather than
inferring it.
